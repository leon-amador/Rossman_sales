![Test Image 4](https://www.signavio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/rossmann-logo-web-600x82.png)

This project is a part of the Rossman competition (https://www.kaggle.com/c/rossmann-store-sales/data) at [Kagle](https://www.kaggle.com/).  Other DS projects can be found on my [GitHub repo](https://github.com/leon-amador?tab=repositories).

#### -- Project Status: [Completed]

## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is starting a true data science experience and get new challenges, this work is very experimental, the choice of XGBoost instead of random forest was based on new attempts to reduce computer memory consumption and experiment less conventional machine learning options.



### Methods Used
* CRISP Methodology aproach
* Machine Learning (Random Forest,XGBoost, Linear Regression)
* Data Visualization
* Predictive Modeling
* CrossValidation
* FineTuning by Random Search
* Feature Selection by Boruta

### Main Technologies
* python
* pandas, jupyter
* boruta, numpy
* sklearn, pickle
* seaborn 

## Project Description
This is a projects based on Rossman data from kagle, the main task is forecasting the 'Sales' column, in order to do that, they provided us with  historical sales data for 1,115 Rossmann stores. The methodology approach utilized was CRISP, in which several study cycles are made, if necessary, in search of the best possible model within the client's needs. The main advantage of using CRISP is being able to provide the client product's versions more quickly, making the machine learning model more valuable to the customer.
